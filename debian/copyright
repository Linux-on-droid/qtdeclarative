 The Qt Company GPL Exception 1.0
 Exception 1:
 .
 As a special exception you may create a larger work which contains the
 output of this application and distribute that work under terms of your
 choice, so long as the work is not otherwise derived from or based on
 this application and so long as the work does not in itself generate
 output that contains the output from this application in its original
 or modified form.
 .
 Exception 2:
 .
 As a special exception, you have permission to combine this application
 with Plugins licensed under the terms of your choice, to produce an
 executable, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
 the terms of your choice. However, the executable must be accompanied
 by a prominent notice offering all users of the executable the entire
 source code to this application, excluding the source code of the
 independent modules, but including any changes you have made to this
 application, under the terms of this license.

License: CC0
 Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
 a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
 the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of
 his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and
 intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 to, the following:
 .
    i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
       communicate, and translate a Work;
   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
       depicted in a Work;
   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
       subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
       in a Work;
   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
       European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
       protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
       including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
       based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
       thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
 makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to
 the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
 Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
 enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
 Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
 royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable
 and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
 in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions),
 (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
 for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
 advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be
 deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.
 Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
 ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness
 shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer
 hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her
 remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
 associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either
 case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
     of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
     otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
     the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
     absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
     extent permissible under applicable law.
  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
     CC0 or use of the Work.
